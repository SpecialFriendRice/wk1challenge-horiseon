# Horiseon Webpage for Module 1 challenge

This webpage with interactive links was created for the first challenge of the EdX Front End Web Development bootcamp. Starter code was modified to make the a webpage for an online marketing company optimised for search engines and more compliant with accessibility standards, as per the acceptance criteria provided along with starter code and assets.

## Description

Updating html to include semantic elements assists both accessibility and search engine optimisation, which were the two main criteria that the client in this example wanted improved. Using semantic html is good practice as it gives both meaning and structure to webpage content, helping search engines recognise elements and how they sit within a heirarchy. In addition it gives greater clarity to those using assistive technology such as screen readers, or developers who need to amend the code in future.

Non-semantic html was replaced, links put in working order, CSS amended and comments added.
